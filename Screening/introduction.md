## What challenges you have faced.

yes, I worked on a faceted filter that allows user to filter products based on more than 10 attributes. Including category, price range, availability, and more.
and just few hours before the deadline, I received major changes that required significant modification to filter functionality.
After discussing this last minutes changes with team members. we rethought the filter logic. we extended our working hours to implement this functionality and finally solutions was delivered time.

New Changes:
1. Filter options changes depending on the user's role. For example, admin can see extra filters like supplier details and inventory status, that regular users don't.
2. user can add combined filter conditions. For example, product that are in stock and have a high ratings.
